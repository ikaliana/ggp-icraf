    <h4>Strategy 3: Increase of Productivity and Diversification</h4>
    <p>The share of agricultural sector in South Sumatra is 17.28% of the regional GDP. This sector provides employment to 56% of the total productive population (Plantation Strategic Plan document). These numbers suggest a disparity between economic share and employment. Increasing crops productivity is one of the biggest challenges in South Sumatra. However, that alone is not enough. Strategy 3 combines economic growth from agricultural sector and crop diversification with emission reduction and environmental conservation efforts – such as the use of organic/non-chemical fertilizers, erosion control, and sustainable pest control. Awareness raising through extension activities, establishment of farmers’group, participation action planning, demonstration plot development, establishment of cooperative units to help with production facilities, technology adoption, and crop diversification using agroforestry approach constitute an important foundation for interventions under Strategy 3.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 3.1 – Low emission irrigated rice cultivation and livestock integration as source of natural fertilizer</h5></p>
    <p>Cultivation of irrigated rice is one of the largest GHG emission contributors in the agricultural sector, especially methane gas (CH4). This is caused among others by prolonged period of flooding, excessive application of chemical fertilizer, and planting of certain variety of rice. Introduction of low-emission rice, especially in irrigated fields, is vital since rice is the staple food and its cultivation would ensure the province’s food security. Several approaches can be used to reduce emission level, such as technology engineering – e.g. intermittent irrigation system – use of organic fertilizer, and planting of certain rice variety that is scientifically proven to be of low-emission (e.g.: Ciherang variety). Intervention to introduce low-emission irrigated rice is combined with livestock management; as yield of irrigated rice, which is the main source of livelihood for many farmers, remains high with the use of non-chemical fertilizer, using organic fertilizer can enhance product’s quality to premium level of organic rice.</p>
    
    <p><h5>Intervention 3.2 – Low emission non-irrigated rice cultivation</h5></p>
    <p>Non-irrigated rice, or upland rice, is rice cultivation practice on dry lands. Its planting cycle usually alternates with horticulture plants. Compared to irrigated rice cultivation, options of agricultural technology manipulation to reduce emission in upland rice farming is more limited. Hence, the focus is on planting low-emission rice variety and use of organic fertilizer. Similar to irrigated rice farming, this intervention needs to be combined with livestock management as source of non-chemical/organic fertilizer, which can also benefit horticulture plants</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 3.3 – Sonor to agroforestry conversion</h5></p>
    <p>One of the causes of land fire in peat and swamp areas is land preparation activities practiced under sonor farming. Sonor is a traditional rice farming system in swamp areas and carried out only during a long dry season (at least 5-6 dry months) or when harvest failure happens. Smallholder farmers tend to burn as much swamp and peat areas as possible without taking any measures to control the fire. Yields from sonor farming is important for family consumption, as there would be no other alternatives to rice planting in a prolonged dry season. Sonor to agroforestry conversion has the potential to contribute to communities’ livelihood improvement as agroforestry would provide a household with a diversified sources of income. It also prevents land clearing practices that involve fire. In addition, incentive and non-cash assistance system should be considered to prevent farmers from reverting to sonor farming.

    <p><h5>Intervention 3.4 – Application of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), agricultural diversification, and post-coffee harvest technology</h5></p>
    <p>South Sumatra contributes significantly to coffee production in Indonesia and accounted for around 20.18% of total yields in 2014. A majority of community coffee plantations in South Sumatra are situated in the highlands, bordering with conservation and protection areas. There is a need to overcome the problem of limited space for expansion and conservation and protection area encroachment. This intervention therefore aims to intensify coffee farming or increase yield per hectare. The application of Good Agricultural Practices in boosting yield is critical, especially the use of grafting techniques. Certified extension officers can help to train farmers performing grafting. In addition, crop diversification may also improve income stability of farmers. This can be achieved through commodity diversification using agroforestry practices and goat farming. GAP and diversification efforts also need to consider the risk of erosion, which in the long rum will reduce soil fertility and water quality. Post-harvest treatment determines a farmer’s price; the intervention is important to encourage farmers to collectively practice red picking and wet processing.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 3.5 – Rubber revitalization and rejuvenation using high quality  seeds, GAP, and balanced fertilizing</h5></p>
    <p>The size of rubber plantations as of 2014 was 1,259,149 hectares. People’s plantation accounts for nearly this entire area and there are more than 500,000 farmers that rely on rubber commodity. Rubber revitalization and rejuvenation using high quality seeds, GAP, and balanced fertilizing can increase rubber yields and is expected to improve the welfare of rubber farmers.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 3.6 – Crops for livelihood program to account for 20% of HTI area</h5></p>
    <p>Minister of Environment and Forestry regulation No. 12/2015 mandates 20% allocation per HTI area as the crops for livelihood zone that can be planted using agroforestry scheme. South Sumatra province has 1.3 million hectare of HTI, which means that crops of livelihood would only need 260 thousand hectares. This represents an important potential to improve the livelihoods of communities around HTI and to preserve the environment, increase carbon sequestration, and restore Watersheds (DAS). Communities may also help to reduce forest and land fire incidents. Community-company partnership in agroforestry development of the Crops for Livelihood is stipulated by Minister of Environment and Forestry regulation No. 32 of 2016. The regulation requires all license holders to facilitate fire-fighting communities (article 22, paragraph 66 and 69-70). There are different ways to realize land potential for the benefit of communities, among others are tripartied partnership of government-community-IUPHHK HTI license holders, strengthen Forest Farmers’ Group, and delivery of technical assistance to farmers concerning agroforestry system. The assistance is provided by extension officers and companies. Other than that, Article 13 of the Minister of Environment and Forestry regulation No. P.39/Menhut-II/2013 stipulates that, in the interests of transparency and accountability for Forest Plantation Communities, a clear contract must be available.</p>
