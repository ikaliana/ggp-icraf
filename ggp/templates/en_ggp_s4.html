    <h4>Strategy 4: Sustainable value chain with equal benefit sharing</h4>
    <p>Sustainable value chains are based on a sustainability concept. This concept is a platform for business growth when applied in production processes, service delivery and supply chains. Managing value chain with a sustainability concept, in stages, enables favorable economic growth, ecological sustainability and social justice. Interventions under Strategy 4 focus on three strategic plantation commodities in South Sumatra (i.e. coffee, rubber, and oil palm), which have unique problems and challenges in establishing a sustainable value chain. Pro-people value chains mostly prioritize the interests and participation of smallholders, not only as producers, but also as commodity industry’s shareholders. Further, partnerships with the private sector of a larger scale need to be fostered more. One of the initial steps is to develop databases of information on harvest locations and farmers’ small businesses.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 4.1 Development of downstream coffee product industry</h5></p>
    <p>As a coffee producing province, South Sumatra can produce 133,645 tons per year, most of which are sent to meet demands from coffee mills in Lampung and Medan. It has made South Sumatra’s coffee less known, leading to small income earned by coffee farmers. Not only does downstream coffee industry improve farmers’ income because it give value added to the commodity, it also stimulates better production and harvesting processes (picking ripe coffee fruits one by one). Downstream coffee industry, supported by geography indication certification, will certainly form South Sumatra’s unique coffee brand, quality and taste, and is expected to produce premium standard coffee with a high price at farm gate. At the national level, this initiative is supported by Government Regulation No. 51/2007 on Geography Indication.</p>
    
    <p><h5>Intervention 4.2 Quantity and quality of rubber auction markets (Rubber Processing and Marketing Units or UPPBs) as a center for clean rubber supply</h5></p>
    <p>Traditional farming and post-harvest handling are the reasons for a decrease in rubber production and the lack of support from actors throughout the supply chain for rubber farmers. This contributes to poverty among rubber farmers. The government has made efforts by involving everyone to enhance the quality of rubber through the improvement of post-harvest quality in order to enhance the quality of rubber nation-wide (SIR). Processed rubber units (UPPBs), consisting of some farmer groups, have proven to be able to introduce good post-harvest handling practices to farmers and thereby enhance the quality of farmers’ rubber products and shorten the rubber marketing chain, leading to a normal price acceptable to farmers. Using public-private partnerships (PPPs) as an approach, the establishment of UPPBs in some areas potential for rubber production and institutional and marketing capacity building will provide farmers with better bargaining power over rubber markets. This will serve as an answer to the root cause of poverty among rubber farmers.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 4.3 Processed rubber product manufacture involving rubber farmers as investors</h5></p>
    <p>Rubber farmers in South Sumatra produce raw rubber for crumb rubber companies through a supply chain that is not supportive of the farmers. With capacity to produce processed rubber products and intermediate goods, rubber farmers are expected to be able to obtain value added from rubber and a higher price than the price they obtain when they sell it after a wet process, which is what they usually do. Business capacity building for farmers with small enterprises and capital support from the private sector are two priorities in this activity. With this activity involving the private sector, farmers will be more economically capable through social-based businesses owned by the rubber farmers.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 4.4 Establishment of mini oil palm mills managed by smallholders</h5></p>
    <p>Social-based businesses owned by oil palm farmers have been established to tackle oil palm farmers’ week bargaining power in oil palm markets. Business capacity building and market coverage expansion are done for mini mills owned by social-based businesses to make oil palm farmers have better competitiveness than that of markets. This will involve the private sector as end users to contribute to the shared value in that products are produced in accordance with specifications that have been set by oil palm markets. As such, oil palm farmers in South Sumatra will obtain better and fairer income through the businesses.</p>
