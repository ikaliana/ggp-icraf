    <h4>Strategy 7: Environmental service incentives and innovative financing of sustainable commodities</h4>
    <p>Based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005, an environmental service is defined as benefits provided by an ecosystem to support people’s wellbeing. Those who contribute to the maintenance and improvement of environmental service availability can be called environmental service providers. Those who benefit from environmental service availability are called environmental service beneficiaries. The benefits obtained from the environment are not only economic value, but also ecological (environmental), social and cultural value. The traditional development paradigm is often based on economic calculation, ignoring non-economic value.</p>
    <p>Green development should not only pursue economic growth, but should always take into consideration environmental and social impacts that may emerge as negative externalities. Therefore, it is important to understand ecosystem services as well as the economic and non-economic value of ecosystem services available in a landscape.</p>
    <p>Environmental services are not provided only by forests, but also by croplands, including agricultural land and plantations. Environmental service conservation and improvement through croplands, including farmlands and plantations, need sustainable commitments from everyone, particularly from environmental service providers to adopt conservation practices and from environmental service beneficiaries to provide incentives.</p>
    <p>Strategy 7 involves the need for knowledge about ecosystem services and promotes incentives and other types of conservation financing towards green growth. With knowledge about potential ecosystem services, a financing scheme can be devised to eliminate negative externalities and protect ecosystem services. An example of such scheme is incentives for environmentally friendly practices or payments for ecosystem services, or commodity certification for the sustainable development of the commodity. In general, there are four ecosystem services for which incentives or financing can be provided. The four ecosystem services are biodiversity, water, carbon, and natural beauty/tourism.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 7.1 – Landscape certification and payments for ecosystem services for watershed and biodiversity governance</h5></p>
    <p>Understanding the concepts of landscapes and ecosystem services is a preliminary move to formulate the correct incentive or financing scheme in order to support landscape governance and conservation. In addition to assessing the possibility of developing landscape certification and payments for ecosystem services, awareness raising and continuous promotion to stakeholders, both the private sector and local communities, are also necessary. Training and field visits related to the implementation of payments for ecosystem services also need to be intensified in order to improve the knowledge of relevant people with potential as implementers.</p>
    <p>To implement the payments for ecosystem services scheme, multi-stakeholder institutions at the provincial level are needed to bridge between environmental service providers and beneficiaries. In addition to facilitating negotiations in payments for ecosystem services, the multi-stakeholder institutions will also manage, disburse and monitor environmental funds. The position and role of such institutions should be in synergy with existing multi-stakeholders forums, including the Watershed Forum.</p>
    <p>The development of financing schemes for environmental service conservation requires enablers including policies, monitoring and evaluation, and institutional and human resource capacity building. At the national level, currently there is legislation that regulates financing instruments for environmental service conservation, but no implementation policies have been made to stipulate steps needed for the implementation of the environmental service financing schemes.</p>
    <p>At the provincial level, from the policy viewpoint, data about existing regulations on ecosystem services and economic instruments for conservation financing, adjustments to strategic plans relevant to environmental service financing, and the development of a work plan for environmental service PPP provider locations need to be collected.</p>
    <p>With regards to monitoring and evaluation (monev), a system for monitoring and evaluating ecosystem services and the contracts is needed at the provincial level. To develop a monitoring and evaluation system, knowledge is needed about landscapes, and therefore a preliminary analysis of ecosystem services at the landscape level (sub-watershed) needs to be conducted. With regards to institutional strengthening, capacity building and awareness raising – at the farmer level about ecosystem services, and at the institutional level about payments for ecosystem services – need to be prepared and conducted in order to support the implementation of incentive and financing schemes.</p>
    
    <p><h5>Intervention 7.2 – Compensated water commodity markets for sustainable water supply</h5></p>
    <p>Water is a commodity that is often considered as an unlimited public good, although the availability is not limited only by natural factors but also by human factors. Understanding obtained through the analysis of water resource management at the landscape level will clarify the potential for and threats to water environmental service availability and conservation need recommendations. Information obtained from the analysis will be used to negotiate compensation for those contributing to water resource conservation, and developing a system for water resource monitoring. In urban areas, to optimize the sustainable use of water, a study needs to be conducted and actions need to be taken in order to improve the efficiency of PDAM’s performance. Overall, disincentive mechanisms, such as environmental taxation, can be used for business activities that threaten the availability of water.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 7.3 – Ecotourism markets with different alternative destinations</h5></p>
    <p>Through an ecotourism approach, tourism development is not only oriented towards profits, but also takes into account conservation and local community empowerment. With regards to planning, an ecotourism plan needs to be developed, specific to potential locations and business models for the local community. Furthermore, community members need to develop a plan in a participatory manner to ensure that ecotourism will provide value added for their livelihoods. In order for a plan to be able to be optimally implemented, information on the environmental and social impacts of ecotourism and the value of ecosystem services available in ecotourism locations is needed during planning. With regards to management, ecotourism area management, including ticketing, should be designed to enable the financing of conservation using revenue from ecotourism. With regards to policies, disincentive mechanisms (e.g. environmental taxation and retribution) should be developed for activities that reduce the quality and quantity of ecosystem services in tourist destinations.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 7.4 – Voluntary carbon markets and initiatives</h5></p>
    <p>South Sumatra is one of pilot provinces for REDD+ in Indonesia. While the implementation of REDD+ is delayed at the national level, the voluntary carbon mechanism (VCM) has been implemented for quite some time and is continuously growing. To support planning, potential locations that can be used for VCM in South Sumatra should be identified. With regards to policies, identification should be conducted to see whether existing policies on land status and other regulations in South Sumatra Province support the implementation of VCM or not. With regards to capacity building, training on how to measure carbon at the site level should be conducted for development actors, while regarding the institutional aspect stakeholders such as NGOs and communities should be encouraged and facilitated to participate in the voluntary carbon mechanism.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 7.5 – Payments for ecosystem services to shift traditional rice farming used by farmers towards agroforestry</h5></p>
    <p>The traditional farming method of clearing peatlands for rice fields burning them is people's habit in some areas in South Sumatra, which needs to be changed because it will potentially trigger fires on peatlands. From the economic and ecological viewpoints, a study should be conducted about the economic and ecological benefits of converting traditional farmed land into agroforests in order to provide evidence that can encourage people to change their farming methods. In addition to information, people who adopt agroforestry should be provided with incentives and support through the provision of micro loans and the establishment of partnerships for agroforestry development, for example through village funds or fire-free funds.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 7.6 – Commodity and environmental service certification in the coffee farming sector</h5></p>
    <p>Coffee product certification will promote good agricultural practices, help protect ecosystem services, and improve land productivity and farmers' income through incentives. To support the development of certification systems, areas selected for coffee product development should be areas with potential for certification. In terms of monitoring and evaluation, a comprehensive database should be developed, including environmental, economic, and social indicators, integrated into the provincial database. Improving farmers' access to markets, particularly for geography-indicated coffee, is an activity to promote the provision of incentives for farmers. With regards to farming methods, coffee farmers adopting farming methods that support ecological functions, such as agroforestry, should be provided with incentives through certification administration simplification. In the longer term, green farming indicators for coffee products should be integrated with agribusinesses' financial systems at the provincial level, for example requirements for a loan or the provision of access to markets.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 7.7 – ISPO and RSPO certification for palm oil companies and smallholders</h5></p>
    <p>The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) began to be adopted in Indonesia in 2005. In 2011, the government issued Regulation of the Minister of Agriculture No. 19/2011 on Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO), requiring all palm oil companies in Indonesia to obtain ISPO certification. One of the challenges to ISPO implementation is how to facilitate smallholders to certify their commodities. To support the development of ISPO certification, particularly for smallholders, the selection of locations for palm oil development programs should be directed towards areas with potential for certification. With regards to monitoring and evaluation, a comprehensive database should be developed, including environmental, economic, and social indicators, integrated into the provincial database. As to farming methods, palm oil farmers adopting farming methods that support ecological functions, such as agroforestry, should be given incentives through certification administration simplification. In the longer term, green farming indicators for palm oil development should be integrated with agribusinesses' financial systems at the provincial level.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 7.8 – Internationally-standardized certification for primary crop zones in industrial timber plantations</h5></p>
    <p>As a province with abundant timber resources, timber product development actors in South Sumatra should be encouraged to adopt the principles of green development through internationally-standardized certification. Therefore, an analysis of timber licensing and certification should be conducted to produce recommendations for procedure improvement at the national level. To promote adoption, companies that adopt sustainable timber certification, such as SVLK, FSC, and FLEGT, are provided with incentives in the form of licensing streamlining or tax reduction. On the other hand, companies that violate regulations should be given disincentives in the form of a fine. In the longer term, green farming indicators for timber product development should be integrated with agribusinesses' financial systems at the provincial level.</p>
