    <h4>Strategy 2: People’s access to development and livelihood capital</h4>
    <p>In ensuring that green growth can meaningfully stimulate inclusive economic growth, people’s access to development and livelihood capitals must be warranted. Development and livelihood capitals refer to Livelihood Capitals concept that introduces five types of capitals – natural, social, human, physical, and financial capitals. Interventions under Strategy 2 are fundamental interventions and are linked with other strategies.</p>
    <p>Under Strategy 2, access to natural capital is realized as access to land for village residents in accordance with the priority of South Sumatra Provincial Government. Provision of land access seeks to optimize Social forestry using partnership scheme to alleviate poverty, safeguard sustainability of forests through joint efforts between the government, communities, and private sector, and to provide easy procedure for the poor to legally certify their lands. This is in accordance with the national government’s program of Agrarian National Operations Project, or PRONA.</p>
    <p>Access to social capital is defined as access to social relations intra and inter-members of the communities by way of supporting community-based governance and activities as well as conflict resolution. The establishment and strengthening of farmers and forestry groups are just an example of social foundation as a forum for community members to be involved in community-led income generating activities – their active participation is also expected to encourage women and young generation to follow and to build partnership with NGOs. Government is expected to demonstrate concrete support towards conflict resolution and apply systematic, contextual, participatory, and collaborative approach.</p>
    <p>Access to human capital is realized as access to extension activities and institutions that provide agricultural, plantation, and forestry extension programs and personnel. Lack of specialized extension staff members on the field for certain commodities is the main problem in centers of primary commodities. Intervention in this area is the foundation to strengthen farmers’ capacity within other interventions in agricultural, plantation, and forestry sectors as well as environmental conservation under other Strategies.</p>
    <p>Access to physical capital in this Strategy is focused on building energy independence among villagers, especially through the development of green bio-energy technology. Access to agricultural facilities and production tools, road networks, and other infrastructures is addressed in a separate Strategy.</p>
    <p>Access to financial capital is realized as intervention to access and communities’ self-reliance by providing financial institutions at village level that is expected to be the pillar of village economic growth. Partnership with banking entities, which could start with awareness-raising on banking services and facilities, is expected to ultimately open more services for the people. This intervention is closely linked with farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural investment, and other financing activities under different Strategies. </p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 2.1 – Optimization of Social forestry and Environmental Partnership</h5></p>
    <p>Social forestry and partnership as well as forest and conservation open up opportunities for forest communities to benefit from the forest without abandoning the practices of sustainable forestry and sustainable forest management. By virtue of the Regulation of Environmental and Forestry Minister P.83/MenLHK/Setjen/Kum.1/10.2016, Indonesia has identified social forestry areas with indicative size of around 13,462,102 hectares located in protection, production, convertible production forest, and limited production forest areas. The size of potential partnership between community members and holders of IUPHHK-HT (Business Permit for Forest Timber Product Utilization-Industrial Plantation), or defined as Crops for livelihood zone, which accounts for 20%, is a total of 2,134,286 hectares (Forestry Minister Decree 2382/Menhut-VI/BRPUK/2015). In South Sumatra, there is 260,602 hectares of potential areas for social forestry partnership scheme. However, this potential – that can be tapped into to improve the welfare of communities around the forest and to conserve forests by proving access to land – has not been optimized. Intervention to optimize social forestry and increase natural capital needs to focus on institutional strengthening, supoort for communities to obtain permit, and monitoring and evaluation on land use.</p>
    
    <p><h5>Intervention 2.2 – Easy and affordable land certification</h5></p>
    <p>Agrarian National Operations Project, or PRONA, is one of the work programs of the Agrarian and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency (ATR/BPN) Ministry. This program is the first program to register land plots and prioritizing poor/disadvantaged villages, fertile or developing agricultural areas, cities’ buffer zones, periurbans or rural poor areas, and people’s economy development areas. PRON aims to uplift the welfare of low to middle-income communities. PRONA implementation in South Sumatra has reached 50.67 per cent; it has registered 26,128 land plots out of the targeted 51,258 land plots in 2016. PRONA is a government-funded program and sourced from BPN’s appropriation according to its Budget Execution List (DIPA). Meanwhile, costs arising from evidence of rights/evidence of land acquisition/ownership, demarcation, duty stamp, and BPHTB/PPh (Tax on acquisition of land and building/Income Tax) are borne by PRONA participants. Despite government support, PRONA has much to improve, among others with respect to the lack of facilities and resources in the spatial office or BPN and the general low awareness on PRONA. Therefore, facilitation of village communities to participate in PRONA and cooperation with BPN at provincial and district level are important efforts to achieve easy and affordable land certification.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 2.3 – Solid Agricultural and Forestry Institutions</h5></p>
    <p>Solid agricultural and forestry institutions are prerequisites for communities to be able to optimally use land and benefit from partnership. In addition, strengthening of village institutions or NGOs is especially vital in order to facilitate access to land (forest) and to lower the rate of illegal open access incidents linked to deforestation, degradation, forest fire, and impacts of climate change. South Sumatra Government by virtue of Bylaw No. 1 of 2013 explicitly expresses its support to local institution, or the forest farmers’ group (KTH).</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 2.4 – Conflict Resolution</h5></p>
    <p>Land conflict in South Sumatra is still significant. Ombudsman has stated that South Sumatra has the sixth highest number of conflicts in Indonesia in 2016 with 22 cases (4.89%). Conflicts primarily concern tenurial issues, especially plantation and forestry land. This shows that conflict resolution – that should start from conflict identification to mediation – still needs to be deeply studied. It is important to also produce conflict resolution guideline. A regulation on tenurial conflict has been issued under Regulation of Environmental and Forestry Minister on Tenurial Conflict Management Guideline No. 84 of 2015; Regulation of PSKL Director General No. 4 of 2016 on conflict mediation; and Regulation of PHPL Director General P.5/PHPL/2015 on the guideline for conflict potential mapping and conflict resolution involving IUPHHK in Production Forest.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 2.5 – Effective and efficient extension activities</h5></p>
    <p>Agricultural extension is the government’s smallholders empowerment strategy that aims to enhance their capacity and knowledge. Extension is stipulated by Law no. 16/2006 on Agricultural, Fishery, and Forestry Extension System; agricultural extension is detailed in Agriculture Minister Regulation Number 47/Permentan/SM.010/9/2016 on Agricultural Extension Program Guideline. Extension officers must be those with the skills and capacity to deliver extension and training activities to farmers. However, due to the lack of officer training and information on current agricultural issues that is obsolete, the skills of extension officers in general become limited. Although extension activities have been taking place, most of the programs are still focusing too much on rice and food plant agriculture, while other commodities are being largely overlooked. Improving extension system is important through high quality training to produce skilled extension officers that are knowledgeable not only in food plants but also in other commodities. </p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 2.6 – Energy Autonomous Village Program</h5></p>
    <p>Energy independence of a village will boost development acceleration especially in disadvantaged and remote villages. Energy Autonomous Village program, or “Desa Mandiri Energi” is one of the targets of Village Ministry in order to reduce the number of disadvantaged villages in Indonesia. Some villages in South Sumatra are located remotely with difficult transportation access. They are entrapped in poverty and not all villages have access to public energy, such as PLN’s electricity. Energy (electricity) helps village residents in conducting their daily activities, including economic activities that can improve the village’s livelihood. There are potentials of energy sources in villages, such as biogas, micro-hydro, and others. The Government can facilitate village residents through awareness-raising activities, training, and infrastructure development; grow the village’s energy potential, and thereby create an energy autonomous village.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 2.7 – Financial institutions in independent villages</h5></p>
    <p>One of the barriers to village economic growth is the extremely limited financial capital access. There is only a small number of individuals in villages who have access to financial institutions to support their economic activities. In addition, knowledge of village communities towards banking facilities and how banks can benefit their business is still low. To support the people’s economy, it is important to bring financial access closer to the people, e.g. by providing banking services at village level. The government also needs to raise awareness of financial institution’s role in supporting agricultural activities in villages.</p>
