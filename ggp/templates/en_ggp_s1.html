    <h4>Strategy 1: Sustainable allocation and land-use planning that addresses the gap between land demand and supply</h4>
    <p>One of the main consequences of economic development that relies on land-based commodities is the increasing demand for land. Land is needed in various fronts – from plantation expansion, plantation forest extension, mining extraction, to infrastructure and industrial zone development. Uncontrolled expansion has serious environmental impacts, which could damage the economy and livelihood of the people in a large scale. These needs will continue to grow as an area develops and as economic growth target becomes more ambitious. On the other hand, it is important to understand that land is limited natural resource. In many cases, land supply is unable to meet land demand. Several things contribute to limited availability of land: (1) biophysical characteristics that determine the suitability of certain landscapes for certain use; (2) spatial planning and local policies that regulate land-use; (3) land ownership that limits land-use; and (4) the rate of land degradation that limits its carrying capacity and function for the benefit of the people.</p>
    <p>This first strategy from the Masterplan for South Sumatra Green Growth is formulated based on an analysis of business as usual scenario simulation informed by land demand data from development plans of government agencies and private agencies in land-based sectors in South Sumatra. Data also comes from spatial planning document and licensing and concession map. The strategy is broken down into 9 interventions that spatially are mapped in order to identify area of intervention. The interventions indicate location and priority at province (Figure 13) and district levels (Table 5).</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 1.1- Land allocation and planning suitable to needs and land availability</h5></p>
    <p>According to South Sumatra Provincial Spatial Planning (RTRWP) and Medium and Long-Term Development Plan (RPJM/RPJP), business as usual scenario simulation suggests large-scale, massive land use conversion potentially takes place in the period of 2018-2030. Land demand identified in regional development plan document is estimated to cause the loss of more than 200,000 hectares of forest in the next 20 years. Forest conversion presumably takes place in order to accommodate the need to expand rubber, palm, and coffee plantations as well as industrial plantation forest. Result of analysis on the simulation concludes that land expansion may also reduce the size of areas with High Conservation Value (HCV). Given the projection, the first intervention under Strategy I proposes to allocate alternative areas that are not only able to mitigate environmental impacts but are also able to boost development effectiveness. This is achieved through, among others, allocate commodity expansion in highly suitable areas based on an area’s biophysical properties and avoid natural forest and HCV areas. Intervention 1 also underlines the importance of having integrated data base of land planning, study, and mapping of HCV land as well as land zonation that observes conservation value and land suitability.</p>
    
    <p><h5>Intervention 1.2- Allocation of access to use forest areas as source of livelihood</h5></p>
    <p>The second intervention under the first strategy towards green growth emphasizes on the importance of allocating development that would allow for better distribution of benefits to poor villages in South Sumatra. Social forestry scheme that enables the use of forest areas for the benefit of the poor needs to be formulated and implemented. Expected results include equal economic growth at the lowest level by allocating the expansion of primary commodities in poor villages. Scope of implementation of this second intervention covers identifying and harmonizing the locations of poor villages in indicative map of social forestry and implementation of social forestry through the development of primary commodities.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 1.3- Releasing forest area for poor villages</h5></p>
    <p>Historical and simulated data on South Sumatra landscape shows the large size of lands managed as plantation and agricultural areas within forests. Without steps to control and prevent further expansion, these areas are projected to increase in the future. Other than protecting remaining forests, the intervention proposed here is to release forest areas that were traditionally managed by local communities. These areas are clearly indicated on South Sumatra land map, consisting of rubber and coffee plantations as well as agricultural areas. Not only releasing forest areas would increase accessibility, this intervention also emphasizes the importance of recognizing the right to manage by revising the provincial spatial planning document.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 1.4- Prioritizing restoration areas</h5></p>
    <p>Estimate on the deteriorating function of landscapes in South Sumatra shows that more 48,000 hectares are degraded and in need of restoration. These areas sprawl from the highlands to the swamplands to the coastline of South Sumatra. Function degradation is caused by various past activities that chip away the landscapes’ capabilty of providing expected function. Past activities include forest and land fire, mineral resources exploitation, and others. Landscape restoration is absolutely necessary in South Sumatra in order to increase the availability of land that is able to meet its desired function. Therefore, this intervention highlights on prioritizing areas for restoration. The master restoration indicative map, which is a result of synchronizing various indicative maps of degraded lands in South Sumatra, is an important initial step in this intervention. It is also important to carefully formulate restoration plan according to desired land function and local context.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 1.5- Allocating rehabilitation and reclamation of mining sites</h5></p>
    <p>One of the types of land degradation that require special attention is ex-mineral mining sites in South Sumatra. Mining is one of the province’s most important economic activity. Continuity of mining sector is a must, but effective measures are needed at the same time to manage post-mining areas. Business as usual scenario projection shows that post-mining areas will only increase in number and size until 2030. These areas require efficient rehabilitation and reclamation efforts so that their function and capacity can be restored and that these areas can be utilized to develop other strategic commodities. This intervention emphasizes on the need to map ex-mining sites, formulate mining rehabilitation and reclamation strategy, and to monitor and evaluate its progress.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 1.6- Limited expansion of coffee plantation</h5></p>
    <p>Coffee is one of the primary commodities with high economic value in South Sumatra’s agricultural sector. Existing coffee plantations have generated significant contibrution not only to the livelihood of coffee farmers, but also to South Sumatra’s economy as a whole. However, based on land coverage change analysis, the trend of past several years indicate a notable increase in land conversion into coffee plantation in forest and protection areas in the upstream of South Sumatra’s landscapes. Future projection shows that these areas will increase if control measures are not introduced and they will pose a threat to the overall function of landscapes in the upstream area/highlands. These areas have high ecological value for South Sumatra as water catchment area as well as area that preserves the quality of watersheds in South Sumatra. Intervention 6 emphasizes on the efforts to manage and allocate coffee plantation expansion in more suitable areas that will not generate negative impacts on the overall landscapes. The desired outcome of this interveation is planned coffee plantation expansion by setting targets and prioritizing lands according to regulations and land conservation efforts.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 1.7- Allocating for rubber revitalization</h5></p>
    <p>South Sumatra is Indonesia’s largest producer of rubber sap. Rubber plantation is the source of livelihood of the millions of farmers in this province and contributes greatly to South Sumatra economy. However, there are aging rubber plantations in South Sumatra that need to be revitalize to maintain and improve yield level of rubber sap. Intervention 7 under Strategy 1 underscores the need to prioritize rubber plantation revitalization by area. Gradual process is needed so that rubber revitalization can continue until all rubber plantations in South Sumatra can provide optimum yield.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 1.8- Moratorium of oil palm expansion on peatlands</h5></p>
    <p>Similar to rubber and coffee plantations, palm is also South Sumatra’s primary commodities that significantly support regional economy from agricultural sector. According to regional development plan, this commodity will continue to grow in the future by way of, among others, extensification. However, in 2016 the Government of Indonesia enforced a moratorium on the expansion of palm plantations in all peat areas in Indonesia. South Sumatra needs to respond to this policy by revising the allocation of lands for palm expansion in the future. This intervention focuses on identifying lands allocated for palm plantation in peat areas and efforts to remove those allocation to mineral area with suitable biophysical properties and function for palm plantation to grow.</p>

    <p><h5>Intervention 1.9- Regulating Micro Zonation in HTI</h5></p>
    <p>Minister of Environment and Forestry Regulation Number 12 of 2015 mandates the allocation of land for crops for livelihood at least 20% of the total HTI. This mandate applies for all Indonesia. Area for Crops for livelihood intended under this regulation refers to areas that are vulnerable to conflicts and/or close to settlements. The purpose is to empower local communities through partnership scheme. The regulation also states more specifically that the crops for livelihood areas shall be developed using agroforestry system to meet the needs of local communities. The last intervention under this strategy aims to provide an indication of the regulation’s implementation in land allocation within HTI concessions in South Sumatra. Under this strategy, lands identified as underutilized (bushes and shrubs, pastures, and open areas) shall account for 20% in HTI concessions and utilized as agroforestry areas.</p>
