    <p>In chapter 1, we have defined the scope of this particular GGPS, i.e, encompassing renewable resources, particularly for the five main commodities.  The main element within GG planning is Land use planning. Various agendas at multiple scales boils down to the need for land. Due to various limitations, not all land demand can be met by the local land availability in all areas. Therefore the process of alignment and prioritization between land requirement and land availability is necessary to constitute fair, effective and sustainable land management in the form of a land use plan.</p>
    <p>A land use plan has to be combined with the other six elements to allow land management to deliver the expected GG outcomes. The six elements are:</p>

    <ol>
    	<li>Access to five capitals (natural, financial, physical, human and social capitals): Some of these capitals are locally-specific, e.g., natural and human capitals, and some are closely interlinked with external factors, e.g., investment, regional network. Without adequate access to the five capitals, some community groups are being left out without sufficient capacity to participate in GG activities such that equality will not be achieved;</li>
    	<li>Productivity and land management practices are to a large extent dependent on technology adoption locally and produce products that are consumed locally or exported outside of the province. Once suitable land is scarce, increased productivity per unit area is an option to  meet the target of economic growth without further expansion and land conversion, and therefore do not inflict negative impacts on environement;</li>
    	<li>The value chain of agricultural/plantation/ forestry products establish linkages between South Sumatran landscapes with global communities (tele-connectivity). Some of the benefit generated along the chain stay within the province and is received by actors within South Sumatra. Better and fairer benefit sharing along the value chain will promote equity and increase social resilience; </li>
    	<li>Regions within South Sumatra, within Sumatra, within the national border and among countries are connected via trade flows of raw and processed products, labor flow, information flow, etc. Conectivity creates an economy of scale that will accelerate economic growth resilience;</li>
    	<li>Forest and landscape restoration aim to recover some functions that have been degraded over time so that such areas can contribute in meeting the gaps between land requirement and land availability. Restoration also improves environmental resilience. An ambitious restoration target has been agreed upon by the global community that ratifies the Bonn Challenge. One of the funding mechanisms is the Tropical Landscape Bond which will soon be in effect;</li>
    	<li>The incentive/disincentive mechanisms of ecosytem services are highly potential in contributing to at least two of the expected outcomes of GG, i.e., maintaining ecosystem health and reducing GHG emissions. Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) is already launched within Law 23/2009 but until now the implementation is still very limited. Likewise, REDD+ which has been seen as a potential global program that provides incentives for GHG emission reduction have not been active to date.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Local or regional contexts where the land-based sector is being managed are crucial in determining feasible and suitable intervention options, including regional typology, institutional setting, social and cultural aspects, local wisdom, investment, partnerships, programs and leaderships. Some of the characteristics and contexts influence both the success factor and the risk level of an intervention option.</p>
