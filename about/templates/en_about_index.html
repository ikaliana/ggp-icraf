    <h4>Opportunities and challenges </h4>
    <p><img align="left" class="responsive-img border" style="margin-left: 0" src="{% static 'images/about1.jpg' %}" />Various events have exhibited negative impacts of unsustainable land and forest exploitation practices. We have seen incidents such as fire, flood, decrease in water river discharge and water quality, and loss of natural habitat in quantity and quality of various animal and plant species. In 2015, fire damaged 737 thousand-hectare land and caused enormous material and immaterial damages. World Bank’s 2016 study stated an estimated total loss of around US$ 3,919 million, including US$ 1,205 million in account of the environment. The 2015 fire, which happened in South Sumatra, emitted around 130.4 MT of CO2e or equal to 93% of the emission that land-based sectors produced in four years (2010-2014).</p>

    <h4>Vision</h4>
    <p>At the end of 2015, South Sumatra Governor officially adopted international Green Growth commitment. All parties concerned in South Sumatra welcome this commitment, among others large and small players in land-based sectors, non-governmental organizations, and international donor agencies.</p>
    <p>The vision starts from huge forest and land fire in South Sumatra in 2015. South Sumatra in 2015 was the province with the highest number of hotspots in Indonesia, i.e. 11,609 hotspots that occurred between July and September with confidence level above 80%. Based on field survey and analysis conducted by South Sumatra Forestry Agency (“Dishut”), at total 726,992 hectares area were burned consisting of 33.87% of natural forest (18% peat and 15.88% mineral fire); 26.73% of rubber or acacia industrial plantation forest (1.78% peat and 24.94% mineral fire); 19.76% of bushes and shrubs (3.49% peat and 16.72% mineral fire); and remaining 19.63% of plantation, rice fields, and other types of land coverage. Spatial analysis indicated that the 2015 fire had the highest intensity within the last 15 years (ICRAF study, unpublished). A World Bank study (World Bank Group, 2016) showed that the total loss was an equivalent of US$ 3.19 million; environmental loss contributed US$1,205 million. In terms of emission, it was estimated that the 2015 fire produced 130,4 Mt CO2e, or equal to 93% total land-based sectors emission in the last four years.</p>
    <p>This incident was clearly against an old and historical tenet of environmental sustainability enshrined in the Talang Tuwo Inscription dated 23 March 684 AD: “may all the plants, the dams, the ponds and all of the good deed that I contributed can be enjoyed for the benefit of all creatures. May the misfortunes would not befell upon them, not being tortured, may all the planets and stars favour their fortunes.</p>
    <p>In order to achieve Green Growth, strategy and plan based on the most valid and reliable information – integrated with existing development and conservation – and participatory in their development process and in voicing aspirations are needed. To that end, it is fundamentally important to have the understanding and the buy-in on the objectives of green growth, its main scope in South Sumatra, challenges, and opportunities.</p>
    <p>Objectives of Green Growth of South Sumatra Province are aligned with national objectives (BAPPENAS, 2015). The objectives are comprehensive, overarching, and relevant with South Sumatra context. The five objectives were identified through a multi-party consultation process at provincial and district level. Five objectives of Green Growth are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sustainable economic growth</li>
        <li>Inclusive and equitable growth</li>
        <li>Social, economic, and environmental resilience</li>
        <li>Health and productive ecosystem as ecological service provider</li>
        <li>Reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) Emission</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <p><img align="left" class="responsive-img border" style="margin-left: 0" src="{% static 'images/about3.jpg' %}" />National Green Growth Road Map covers all sectors of manufacturing, extractive and energy, infrastructure, and renewable energy that are oriented towards Green Growth. In South Sumatra, the Masterplan for Green Growth is focusing on renewable energy by driving productivity levels of agricultural, plantation, agroforestry, and forestry sectors. Production increase shall, at the same time, safeguard and recover forest and peatland conditions through strengthened partnership with private sector, farmers, public at large, and conservation experts. A mechanism for ecosystem services return will be especially underlined in this Masterplan.</p>
    <p>Land resources make up the nexus between development and environment. Rural development is largely underpinned by agricultural and plantation expansion, which includes forest conversion. Conversion is primarily driven by economic factors; whether as a way to address global, local, and regional demand, forest conversion renders adverse impacts on ecosystem function. Healthy ecosystem that is able to generate ecosystem services – such as DAS conservation, climate control, preservation of land fertility, cultural benefits, yields, and biodiversity – are needed by the communities in order to survive. Disrupted ecosystem affect the quality of ecosystem services and, in turn, living quality of human being. </p>
    <p>Other sectors, such as road infrastructure, sea ports, and industries that determine connectivity and economies of scale, are sectors that influence or support land/based sectors in generating benefits to the greatest extent and as equally distributed as possible to various parties. This document discusses factors that are closely linked with the size of benefits, the extent of its equal distribution or otherwise, sustainability, or availability of benefits from land-based sectors.</p>
