    <p>The planning process is built upon a number of foundational principles as outlined below:</p>

    <ul class="standard-list">
    	<li> 	Inclusive: relevant stakeholders within the vertical and horizontal processes should be actively involved in the process of developing and negotiating scenarios of GG so that the aspirations, concerns and constraints can be identified early enough in order to avoid future conflicts, resolve existing conflicts and increasing the factor of success in the implementation of the GG plan that is made jointly and accepted widely; </li>
    	<li> 	Integrative: coherence between the programs and activities across sectors and institutions as well as synchronization of expected outcomes that are locally and temporally specific is  needed to increase effectiveness, avoid overlapping and sylo effect  so that the achievement is long-term and can be upscaled</li>
    	<li> 	Informed: well founded by data, information and valid models so the ex-ante impact of the trade-offs that would occur if a GG scenario is implemented can be analyzed and can serve as a basis for mutistakeholder negotiation. For example, say that within the GG scenario, an area of Musi Rawas, a district in the norther part of the province, is to be converted into oil palm. Based on maps generated from satellite imageries, the area is covered by natural forest that retains high carbon stocks as well as assumes buffering function of the watershed. By using LUMENS (Land Use Planning for Multiple Environmantal Services), the trade-off between the negative impact on emissions and watershed functions against the economic benefits can be analyzed. Prospective analysis, ex-ante, what-if scenario is also envisioned in the SEAs but until now has not been widely implemented mostly due to limited technical capacity.</li>
    </ul>
