    <h4>1. Rationale</h4>
    <p>South Sumatra Province is of high significance in Indonesia for several reasons: 1) It is the fourth-richest in natural resources, providing a substantial share of GRDP from the land-based sector; 2) The multiplier effect from the forestry sector has seen the creation of important sources of revenue; 3) It is the foremost producer of rubber and coffee in the country, with the largest area under cultivation; and 4) The area under oil palm is the fourth-highest nationally.</p>
    <p>Poverty incidence is in the lower ranking across all of Indonesia’s provinces, however, five years ago the rate of decline in poverty was ranked 14th in Indonesia. Inequality is lower than the national average, however, GRDP is lower than the average GRDP of Sumatra. Economic growth in 2015 was higher than the national and Sumatran averages. Infrastructure development is the priority, especially, via the Special Economic Zone in Tanjung Api-Api Port, Banyuasin District. Other than that, energy and regional development remain priority programs. In preparation for the Asian Games in 2018, transportation infrastructure is also rapidly being developed.</p>
    <p>South Sumatra is clearly at the crossroads. In most provinces on densely-populated neighbouring Java, options for land-based development are mostly about intensification. But on other islands and provinces with low population densities, lack of infrastructure and rich forests, extensification is actively sought. South Sumatra is in a good position to mix between the two strategies but should do so wisely and sustainably. In boosting the economy, South Sumatra has been successful in attracting investors to the land-based sector. Forest plantations account for 14.5% of the total area of the province, featuring in 8 out of the 17 districts. In 2014, of the total number of households that manage tree crops, two-thirds managed rubber, a quarter coffee and the rest oil palm. The amount of land dedicated to oil palm cultivation has been grown rapidly from 0.87 million ha in 2011 to 1.11 million ha in 2014. Approximately 43.3% of the oil palm is managed by smallholders. With a large capacity mill developed by APP in OKI to be operational by 2018, a new wave of change is anticipated through labor absorption, revenues and multiplier economic effects.</p>
    <p>Such achievement does not come without costs. Deforestation is vast, incidences of peat subsidence and fire have been well documented. Protected areas are under threat from illegal logging and encroachment. Associated with development, some ecosystem services have begun to degrade. Musi Watershed has been identified as one of the most critical watersheds in Indonesia, with flooding, erosion, and poor quality and inconsistent water availability being a few of many issues. Land-based sector emissions have been high, especially from conversion of mangrove forests. Forest and land fires in 2015 further damaged ecosystem services while negatively effecting health, economic activities and environmental quality. Peat occupies 16% of the total area of the province; fire and drainage systems have accelerated a huge amount of greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
    <p>Sustainability is crucial for South Sumatra in making decisions about land management during this period of rapid global change. Trade-offs between economic growth, environmental degradation and social inclusion have to be understood, anticipated and addressed carefully through an integrated approach that embraces a given landscape as a holistic system of interconnected, sub-landscapes managed by individuals and public and private-sector entities within intertwined processes along value chains of products and services. A strong negotiation process is a must for building understanding and trust among all involved to address the trade-offs through identifying plausible conservation-and-development scenarios, understanding the consequences of each and working towards a win-win scenario.</p>
    <p>Scale is a very important but often difficult issue to address. The scale of land-based economic activities most often does not coincide with the scale of the impact of such activities and, therefore, consequences are imposed on others beyond those initially involved. A direct cause-and-effect loop is broken; reaching sustainability becomes a potentially insurmountable problem. Related to this is the issue of priority: local, immediate problems and solutions are understandably almost always top priority. When this conflicts with larger demands for either products or ecosystem services, a combination of effective land-use policies and regulations  including spatial plans, incentives and disincentives and innovative mechanisms needs to be in place. REDD+ can be one type of incentive mechanism that incorporates the global need for better climate regulation into local implementation of land management to reduce loss of carbon stock and emissions and sequester more carbon. The provincial level is responsible for the governance of an intermediate geographical scale and, therefore, is well placed for playing a facilitating and coordinating role to achieve green growth for the region and the sub-regions. This can be done by contributing nationally, that is, facilitating global players (consumer countries of commodities) in investing and being responsible, ‘green’ economic actors while coordinating local producers as the economic actors and accountable environmental stewards. Green growth should avoid deforestation, peat subsidence, greenhouse-gas emissions while also improving the prosperity and productivity of farmers. Such a public-private-people partnership is the most important precursor to achieving green growth locally and nationally and in contributing to the SDGs.</p>
    <p>The Government of South Sumatra Province, led by Governor Alex Noerdin, has shown initiative and commitment in taking the leading role in developing a Green Growth Plan that includes increasing agricultural and forestry production while protecting and restoring forest and peat through strengthening partnerships between the private sector, conservationists and civil society. IDH has been actively supporting South Sumatra by convening the private sector, including Asia Pulp & Paper, London Sumatra, Cargill, Musim Mas and Wilmar; associations, such as GAPKI (Indonesian Palm Oil Association) and APHI (Indonesian Forestry Association); and NGOs, such as ZSL and HAKI.</p>
    <p>Under the current government, South Sumatra has achieved the needed momentum to transform its economy into one based on green growth, thanks to strong political will, capacities, networks, support, and resource levels. It is imperative that an inclusive, integrative and informed master plan on green growth for South Sumatra, which encompasses the national agenda, local needs and regional contexts while also accommodating global demands, is created to act as a roadmap towards a sustainable region with healthy green growth and equity. Such a plan will ensure a contribution toward achieving the SDGs while providing an exemplary green-growth case to other provinces in Indonesia.</p>
    <p>ICRAF, the World Agroforestry Centre, has been comissioned by the Government of South Sumatra, IDH and multiple partners to conduct analytical study within inclusive processes with multiple stakeholders to develop a Green Growth Plan (GGP) for South Sumatra (SS). The technical document will serve as a basis of the policy document on GGPSS.</p>

    <h4>2. Green growth vision of South Sumatra</h4>
    <p>Towards the end of 2015, the Governor of South Sumatra declared the Green Growth vision of South Sumatra to the global community. This commitment was welcomed by multiple stakeholders across South Sumatra, such as land-based investors and managers across scales, NGOs, academics and multidonors.</p>
    <p>Amongst other factors, the 2015 South Sumatra forest fire and land fire, which was one of the worst fires in recent memory, was a major driving factor in pushing towards a commitment. In 2015, 11,609 hotspot were identified mostly between July and September, which is the highest number across Indonesia’s provinces. Based on the field survey and analysis conducted by Forestry Office of South Sumatra, 727,000 hectares were burned: almost two third were from natural forest (more than half of which was peat) and in the areas of pulp wood and rubber plantation. According to the World Bank, damages totalled 3.919 billion USD, including an environmental cost of 1.205 billion USD. A rough estimation of emissions due to the 2015 fire in South Sumatra is 130.45 Mt CO2e (ICRAF, unpublished).</p>
    <p>This massive fire is not aligned with the spirit of environmental conservation which has been part of ancient local wisdom, as reflected in the Talang Tuwo inscription of 23 March, 684: "may all the plants, the dams and ponds, and all the charities that I provide be beneficial for all creatures; may they be protected from catastrophe and suffering; may all the planets and galaxies be kind/sustainable".</p>
    <p>In achieving green growth vision, it is imperative to have a strategy and plan that is: (i) well founded and supported by the best available information; (ii) integrated to existing development and conservation plans; (iii) inclusive to all relevant stakeholders in the planning process and in voicing their aspirations. It is fundamental for multiple stakeholders to understand and agree on the outcomes, scope, challenges and opportunities of green growth in South Sumatra.</p>

    <h5>2.1. Expected outcomes</h5>
    <p>At this reporting stage, the expected outcomes of Green Growth for South Sumatra province adopt those of the national Green Growth’s expected outcomes (Bappenas, 2015) which are quite comprehensive, general and relevant to South Sumatra’s context. This set of outcomes was conveyed and consulted publicly during the kickoff meeting with multiple stakeholders at the province and district level. They have also been communicated to the Governor during the small meeting between the Governor, IDH and ICRAF following the kick off meeting. The expected outcomes are:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Sustainable economic growth</li>
        <li>Inclusive and equal growth</li>
        <li>Social, economic, and environmental resilience</li>
        <li>Healthy and productive ecosystems in providing ecosystem services</li>
        <li>Reduction of GHG emissions</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>2.2. Scope</h5>

    <p>In the national road map document for GG, all sectors from manufacturing, exctractive and energy, and infrastructure to renewable resources are targeted in promoting GG. For South Sumatra, at this stage, the GGP will be focused on main renewable resources through the increased agricultural production and forestry while maintaining and restoring forests and peat by strengthening partnerships between the private sector, farmers, civil society and conservationists. Incentive mechanisms for ecosystem services such as PES will receive special attention in this master plan.</p>
    <p>Our approach is land-centric and based on land science, which is a nexus between rural development and forestry with the conservation of natural resources and environmental services they provide, such as the maintenance of watershed function, climate regulation, soil fertility, cultural benefits, harvested products, as well as biodiversity. Forest and land use changes that are largely driven by economic factors, both related to the global market as well as local and regional needs, have an impact upon ecosystems functions.</p>
    <p>This requires reconciliation between land requirements, estimated from the development plan and past trends of land use changes, with the availability of land, which refers to a variety of limiting factors of biophysics, allocation of functions, tenure and conservation value. A proper land use plan should minimize the negative environmental impacts and optimize benefits from land-based development equally among stakeholders.</p>
    <p>The sectors such as transportation and industries that determine connectivity, hence affect the 'economies of scale', are the determining and enabling factor for the land-based sectors to produce maximum and equitable benefits for all stakeholders. Six main factors that are identified as determining and enabling to the extent, distribution and sustainability of benefit from land-based sectors are: (i) access to five capital (natural resources, financial, infrastructure, human resources, and social); (ii) the productivity and land management practices; (iii) the value chain of agricultural/plantation/forestry products; (iv) connectivity; (v) restoration; (vi) incentive and disincentive mechanisms of ecosystem services.</p>
    <p>Local context in which the land-based sector can be managed in achieving the green growth target is very important in determining the appropriate intervention options, including: regional typology, institutional setting, social and cultural aspects, local policies, investments, partnerships, programs and leaderships. Some of these characteristics and context influence the feasibility of an intervention option as well as the level of risk. All seven elements of activities constitute the GGP which thematically and holistically needs to be conducted in an integrated manner through cross-sectoral coordination and partnership between government, private and people. At this stage, GGP will be focused on the five main commodities of South Sumatra, namely: rubber, coffee, oil palm, rice and pulp wood.</p>

    <h5>2.3. Proposed role and position of GGP in the constellation of the plan document and planning process in South Sumatra province</h5>

    <p>The active long term development plan (RPJPD) covers the period 2005-2025, while the current medium term development plan (RPJMD) is the third within this RPJP, which covers the period 2015-2018. The existing spatial plan (RTRWP) covers the period 2013-2033.</p>
    <p>Vision of RPJPD: South Sumatra is outstanding and at the forefront in 2025.</p>
    <p>In an effort to realize this vision, the mission of South Sumatra Province 2005-2025 are formulated as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>to make South Sumatra the motor of regional economic growth;</li>
        <li>to improve the utilization of natural resources for the provision of sustainable energy and food;</li>
        <li>to increase the quality of life of people, and</li>
        <li>to enhance the management capacity of the government</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal of the RTRW: achieving a South Sumatra Province that is productive, efficient and of high quality towards the outstanding and leading province by utilizing its natural resources sustainably.</p>
    <p>The design of spatial structure is directed to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>    create integration of the urban systems;</li>
        <li>    develop key infrastructures in the region that can become the direction, formation, hub, centre and motor of the regional development towards urban systems in the province of South Sumatra;</li>
        <li>    develop regional infrastructures which can be the driving force of regional development;</li>
        <li>    promote the implementation and the role of the Provincial Strategic Region (KSP) in achieving equitable growth and population distribution in the region. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Meanwhile, the design of spatial patterns includes the development of conservation and cultivation areas. Conservation areas are targeted to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>    strengthen the function of conservation areas that meet the criteria of protected areas;</li>
        <li>    maintain and improve the quality of the conservation area. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cultivation areas are directed to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>    improve the productivity of waste land (non-productive land);</li>
        <li>    increase the productivity of agriculture, tree cropping, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries in order to ensure food security and establishing South Sumatra as national food producers;</li>
        <li>    optimize the potential of cultivated land and natural resources in order to boost socio-economic growth in the underdeveloped region due to the limited carrying capacity and environmental capacity;</li>
        <li>    improve the region's roles in defense and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Synchronization and synergy of RPJMD and RTRW South Sumatra Province aim to:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Establish South Sumatra province as a geographical region that is safe, comfortable, productive and sustainable for the achievement of public welfare;</li>
        <li>Provide protection of spatial functions and the prevention of negative impacts on the ecosystems due to spatial use;</li>
        <li>Increase the integration of natural resource management and man-made resources with due regard to human resources;</li>
        <li>Improve the integration of spatial planning at the districts/cities with the national and province;</li>
        <li>Accomplish the integration of spatial use of land, sea and air, including below ground;</li>
        <li>Fulfill the management and sustainable use of natural resources for improving the welfare of society; and</li>
        <li>Maintain the balance and harmony of cross-regional development and the synergy of activities between sectors and between SKPD.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The direction of the Governor of South Sumatra Province for development in the period 2013-2018 are to:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Increase economic growth which is balanced in terms of expenditure, production and inflation control;</li>
        <li>Increase the stability of the region through these three aspects: 
            <ul>
                <li>    economic stability by maintaining the stability of prices and exchange rates;</li>
                <li>    social stability by preventing social conflict, and</li>
                <li>    political stability by strengthening defense and security and strengthen the implementation of the General Election and Local Election;Increase economic growth which is balanced in terms of expenditure, production and inflation control; and</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Improve sustainable environmental management and disaster management with the conservation and use of the environment to support economic growth and sustainable prosperity, along with disaster risk control and management to anticipate climate change.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Of all the medium- and long-term plan documents and the direction of the Governor of South Sumatra province in the 2013-2018 period, the five expected outcomes of GG above are very central. The scope of the GG that includes renewable resources, in particular the increase in economic growth through land-based sector, namely agriculture, tree-crop plantation and forestry, contributes significantly to the provincial economy (as noted in section 1. above). </p>
    <p>Horizontal and vertical synchronization between the Development Plan and Spatial Plan is captured in a diagram by Mungkasa, 2013 (Figure 1). Three important points to note are:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The Development Plan is referred to by the Spatial Plan but the opposite is not true; the Spatial Plan should be referred to by Development Plan, as well. The Development Plan should refer also to the RTRW because the information about the capabilities and availability of land are only captured in RTRW, and this should be used as the basis for setting realistic indicators that adopt the principle of sustainability by taking into account the environmental factors; </li>
        <li>There is no linkage between the RTRW with the activity plan (RKP), sectorial strategic plan and working plan. One of the main obstacles in reaching seamles processes is that the RKP, Strategic plan and working plan are not spatially explicit. This can result in inefficiency, especially those closely related to the land-based sector. Monitoring and Evaluation process is difficult to administer;</li>
        <li>Collaboration between SKPD are discouraged or impossible when RPJM is already translated into the Strategic Plan, and then Renja. The element connectivity and regional approach is hence difficult to achieve at this stage and, as a result, the 'economies of scale' is low, especially when regional heterogeneity is high in terms of land suitability, transport infrastructure, population distribution and others. </li>
    </ol>

    <br><b>Figure 1.</b> Synchronization of Development Plan and Spatial Plan.<br>
    <span style="font-size: smaller">(Mungkasa, 2013. Direktur Tata Ruang dan Pertanhan, Bappenas)</span></p>

    <p>The three points above can become the constraints in integrating the two plans especially those closely related to land-based development.</p>
    <p>Breakthroughs and some fundamental changes as outlined in Presidential Decree 45/2016 on RKP 2017, which should be considered by the region are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>    That the planning approach should be: (i) thematic-holistic: coordination between Ministries; (ii) integrated: related sectors must plan together in an integrated manner within the overall value chain; (iii) spatial: locations of planned activities have to be spatially explicit;</li>
        <li>    The new budgeting policy ties up closely the national RKP with that of provinces and districts. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In connection with GGP, this new breakthrough can be used to place GGP as a provincial priority program which is thematic and holistic, involving relevant SKPD in the process of integrated planning, budgeting, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. The spatial approach becomes very important since integrated activities should be planned in specified locations (co-locations). Therefore, RTRW is very important and directly related to RKPD.</p>
    <p>In addition, by taking GGP as a priority program for South Sumatra province, where land-based sector development is a substantial part of the overall development and specific characteristics of South Sumatra need special attention, the activities can be planned integratively by SKPD and linked to Natonal RKP in the budgeting process, based on the guideline in Perpres 45/2016. The new planning approach will increase the budget efficiency.</p>
    <p>Further, GGP should be formulated as a long-term priority, be developed as a Regional Policy, and mainstreamed into RPJP and RTRW to bridge the transitions between governments linked to the election period. GGP is a meeting point between RPJM and RTRWP. Zonation within the province is one of the basis of GGP to boost the integration among districts and within province. Local characteristics, local needs and multistakeholders' aspiration and the district interlinkages should be synthesized into a bigger picture, in order to achieve "The outstanding and leading South Sumatra in 2025".</p>

    <br><b>Figure 2.</b> Tentative proposal of GGP interlinkages with programs and SKPD. Note: to be completed, reviewed and consulted with stakeholders</p>

    <h5>2.4. Opportunities</h5>

    <p>In planning, some opportunities for GG need to be recognized and utilized in achieving GG effectively. First, South Sumatra has ample capital to achieve GG : (i ) strong leadership of the Governor of South Sumatra in taking the initiative and making a commitment to the global and national communities; (ii ) a conducive business climate, investment and partnership with the private sectors in the palm oil and pulp and paper industries; (iii ) farmer community with local wisdom and technical capabilities in managing their land and participating in economic activities; (iv) land and forest resources, and minerals; (v) adequate supporting infrastructure as an initial capital; (vi) strategic location geographically.</p>
    <p>Globalization is also a huge opportunity because of the tele-connection between demand for products and services with the provision (supply) locally. With the raising consumer awareness of the potential negative envrionmental impacts that can be generated along the production chain, companies must be able to demonstrate that their production chain is environmentally friendly and socially sound. This connectivity dictates close partnerships between private sectors and others particulary in achieving business sustainability.</p>
    <p>The time is ripe now for formulating GGP as an integrated and innovative plan with the call for increased efficiency due to the budget cuts. Looking at the land-based sector opportunities, South Sumatra is at a crossroad. On the one hand, intensive land management has been practiced widely, mainly in the southern part of the province, which resembles districts in Lampung province to the south of South Sumatra. On the other hand, land management practices that are much less intensive, based on mixed trees and annual planting, are still common in the northern part of the province, almost like districts in Jambi province to the north of South Sumatra. Options are open for either increasing intensity of land use practices, expansion or value added industrialization of products in the downstream, but should be made wisely so that the five desired outcomes for the GG can be achieved. All these opportunities provide good stepping stones in planning GG in order to achieve GG.</p>
